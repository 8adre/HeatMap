Introduction
Using this software you can see where users click or move a mouse cursor on you web sites.
You need at least one server instance, from where web sites get code and send data.
The server gathers data and provides GUI to preview heat maps.

Installation on server
Create in MySQL database named `heatmap`.
Import db/structure.sql file into the database.
Download or build (see "Development" section) Heatmap.war.
Deploy it on application server e.g. GlassFish.
Change database access in WEB-INF/classes/hibernate.cfg.xml.
Visit http://<<glassfish>>:<<port>>/heatmap/ to see if the application works.

Installation on web site
There is JavaScript template code that should be inserted into tracked web site:
<script type="text/javascript">
var _hm = _hm || {};
_hm.align = 'center';
_hm.contentWidth = function(){return $('body>header').width();}
window.onload=function() {
  var script = new Array('jquery','jquery.cookie','heatmap');
  for(i in script) {
    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;
    ga.src = 'http://<<glassfish>>:<<port>>/heatmap/' + script[i] + '.js';
    var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(ga, s);
  }
}
</script>
You should change:
_hm.align - depending where is the whole content located on web page: 'left', 'center', 'right'.
_hm.contentWidth - should return width of the content mentioned above.
Now mouse position will be calculated independent from window size
Code 'jquery' and/or 'jquery.cookie' can be removed if the web page already use jquery/jquery.cookie accordingly.
Change <<glassfish>>:<<port>> to the server address.

Heat maps view
Go to: http://<<glassfish>>:<<port>>/heatmap/preview/
Type URL of web page where mouse events are tracked and change other options if needed.
User ID is optional, if not chosen, data from all of them will be displayed.
Press Enter or "Go".
Check "Show heat map" if not checked.
Data that fit to the options will be displayed on image covering the site.
Use scroll below options to change the image opacity.

Development
Heatmap is written in Java 7 and developed in Netbeans 7.4 RC2.
Database is designed in MySQL Workbench.
Git as control system.
To proper work of preview, the jQuery UI is needed - unpack jquery-ui-*.zip to web/ directory.
